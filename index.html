        <P>I have been working in an IT role for many years which began in an IT supporting role and leading up to my present role as a Tester. I’s journey to a QA Tester started when I was in a project at Transport NSW Jan 2016, his primary
          responsibilities involved troubleshooting, smoke testing and resolving of system related issues, and ensure software compatibilities before its release to the production environment. </<p>
          <p>I'm relishing the role of a systems tester which provides him with the opportunity to find defects before the product is released to end users. </p>
          <p>Furthermore, I've had the utmost satisfaction in discovering other areas of system testing through trial and error, including various approached and techniques in detecting of software bugs and other unknown errors. </p>
